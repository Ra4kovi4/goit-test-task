This application is developed in React using Axios library and routing that allows you to navigate between pages. It is designed to view users' tweets with the ability to filter by all users and the subscription status of each user.

When the user starts the application, a list of all users and their tweets is displayed to the user. The user can filter the list by subscription status. Each item in the list is presented as a card, which contains the user's avatar, number of tweets and followers, and a subscribe/unsubscribe button.

The app allows you to upload more tweets when needed and automatically scroll through the list of users when you click the "Scroll to top" button. 

Overall, the app provides a user-friendly interface for viewing users' tweets with the ability to filter and manage subscriptions.
